```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Loading the data
```{r} 
data <-
  read.csv(
    "C:/Users/neo/Documents/Privat/R/Summary Code/summary2.csv",
    header = TRUE,
    sep = ";"
  )
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
